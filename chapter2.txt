So let's go ahead and create some text files.  
Windows:
C: \users\noera_000\Desktop\Story>type nul > chapter2.txt
So I'm going to use touch to create a file called chapter1.txt, and then I'm going to open  chapter1.txt.  

Now, on Windows, instead of using open as the command, it's start.
start chapter2.txt
