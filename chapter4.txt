 So to see what's currently inside your staging area, you can use the git Status
 command 
C: \users\noera_000\Desktop\Story>git status

and it shows  you that there are untracked files which will be shown in red. 
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
(use git add <file> …” to include in what will be committed)

	chapter2.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use “git add” to track)
And this is something that's simply inside your working directory,  so inside here, but it's not yet in the staging area.  So in order to add it to the staging area and to start tracking changes in it, then we have to use  the command git  add. So we're going to type git add and we're going to type the file name.  So in this case, it's chapter2.txt. 

C: \users\noera_000\Desktop\Story>git add chapter2.txt.
